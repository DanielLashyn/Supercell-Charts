# Supercell-Charts


## Background

Throughout my high school years, I played Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, and Brawl Stars during my free time. Because of this I become obsessed with finding the optimal progression path. In the winter of 2015, I created excel charts to track the progression for the different supercell games. 

The following excel files are the charts I used to track the different progression for my accounts. I also used these charts to give guidance to community members on what to upgrade.

Do note that I since dropped playing each of these games since 2018, making the information outdated.

Lastly these charts were created before Supercell released API for the games. Hence why there is no use of the API in these document.

### Clash Royale
The following images show the progressions for the different card rarities. The tables were set up with the following heading:
- ```Cards Collected```: The current number of cards a player has for that card.
- ```Level```: Current level that card is at
- ```Cards to next level```: Shows the number of missing cards needed for next upgrade.
- ```Request left```: Number of requests needed to obtain the missing cards for the next level.
- ```Days left```: Approximate number of days until that card is ready to upgrade to the next level. 
- ```Estimated date of next level```: Shows the date that card will be ready to upgrade.
- ```Gold for next level```: The amount of gold needed to be upgraded to the next level.
- ```Level could be at```: The level that card could be at.
- ```Gold for level be at```: The amount of gold needed to upgrade the card to the level it could be at.
- ```Cards to max level```: Cards needed to reach max level.

The following image shows the progression information to a selected level. This was useful as certain game modes (ie challenges) only need cards to be upgraded to a certain level. The table was set up with the following heading:
- ```X level```: The level the player wants to upgrade to.
- ```Cards to next level```: The remaining cards needed to reach the targeted level.
- ``` Request left```: Number of requests needed to obtain the targeted level.
- ```Days left```: Number of days until that card is ready to upgrade to the targeted level.
- ```Estimated date of the next level```: Approximate date that card could be upgraded to targeted level.
- ```Gold to level X```: Amount of gold needed to upgrade to the targeted level.
- ```xp to x level```: Amount of xp gotten from upgrading that card.
