# Supercell-Charts


## Background

Throughout my high school years, I played Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, and Brawl Stars during my free time. Because of this I become obsessed with finding the optimal progression path. In the winter of 2015, I created excel charts to track the progression for the different supercell games. 

The following excel files are the charts I used to track the different progression for my accounts. I also used these charts to give guidance to community members on what to upgrade.

Do note that I since dropped playing each of these games since 2018, making the information outdated.

Lastly these charts were created before Supercell released API for the games. Hence why there is no use of the API in these document.
