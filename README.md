# Supercell-Charts


## Background

Throughout my high school years, I played Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, and Brawl Stars during my free time. Because of this I become obsessed with finding the optimal progression path. In the winter of 2015, I created excel charts to track the progression for the different supercell games. 

The following excel files are the charts I used to track the different progression for my accounts. I also used these charts to give guidance to community members on what to upgrade.

Do note that I since dropped playing each of these games since 2018, making the information outdated.
